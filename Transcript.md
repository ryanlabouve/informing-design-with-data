"At Etsy, like many companies these days, product designers are responsible for staying active and involved throughout the entire development process. From product definition to user flows to wireframes to visual design to, yes, writing and deploying their own HTML and CSS, designers are tasked with staying involved from start to finish."
"However, we expect the same of our engineers and product managers - we push everyone on a team to be involved in every step of creating great products. When we brainstorm and blue sky ideas, we do it together. When we have user research going on, we’re all tuned in and watching. When we talk about findings or data or how to best accomplish a goal through design or engineering, we do so as a team. We not only rely on each other’s expertise, but also a shared understanding of our focus areas in order to conceive, design and implement our roadmaps."

You have to be compelled to push yourself to become better at the things you’re not good at. Don’t be afraid to fail.
