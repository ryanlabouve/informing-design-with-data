							'There is this company that I worked with a couple of years ago that were doing coupons. Their site looked a little crazy. We said, “We can make this better.” We redesigned all the visual design... We put it back in front of customers, and they looked at this new, fancy visual design that looked really good, and they said, “Wait, who’s behind this thing? Are people making money off of me?” We realized that we screwed it up. We tried to make it beautiful for us, but in doing so, we broke the product.'

						<p>How a design shop might do this:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The facilitator presents the design on a big display, or prints it out and put it on the wall.</li>
							<li>We go around the table, over and over again. During their turn, each person can share one (and only one) tension she or he has with the presented design, elaborating on the tension to the extent they deem necessary.</li>
							<li>Tensions don’t have to be exclusive — you can repeat or add to another person’s prior tension.</li>
						</ul>
						<small><a href="https://medium.com/designing-medium/tactical-design-critique-bb74d1a5e350">https://medium.com/designing-medium/tactical-design-critique-bb74d1a5e350</a></small>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>How a design shop might do this (con't):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Or you can skip (pass) your round if you can’t think of a tension at this moment.</li>
							<li>Cross-talk (other people speaking out of their turn) is discouraged, unless it is used for clarification (“Wait, what did you mean by…?”).</li>
							<li>The whole thing is capped at 20 minutes, or whenever we run out of things to say (everybody in the room skipped their round in sequence). The facilitator takes care of the order and keeps the meeting running smoothly.</li>
						</ul>

					<section>
						<p>Some of our personal rules (at Raisemore):</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Leave your ego at the door</li>
							<li>Strong oppinions held losely</li>
							<li>Be kind, or be quite</li>
