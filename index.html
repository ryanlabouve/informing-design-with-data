							'There is this company that I worked with a couple of years ago that were doing coupons. Their site looked a little crazy. We said, “We can make this better.” We redesigned all the visual design... We put it back in front of customers, and they looked at this new, fancy visual design that looked really good, and they said, “Wait, who’s behind this thing? Are people making money off of me?” We realized that we screwed it up. We tried to make it beautiful for us, but in doing so, we broke the product.'
